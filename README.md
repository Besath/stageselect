# Stage Selector

This plugin lets you save teleport locations on a map, and teleport to said locations from a menu.

## Usage

ADMIN: sm_regstage <name> | !regstage <name> - Saves caller's current location in the database and assigns it the given name.

EVERYONE: sm_courses | sm_stages | !courses | !stages - Opens a selection menu with all the teleport locations saved for the current map.
